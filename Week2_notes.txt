## Beginning of week 2 ##

### Reading and Writing Files ###

> To open a file:

file = open("spider.txt") ## opening file
print(file.readline())

print(file.read())

file.close() ## closing file

* It is a good idea to close your file whenever you are done with your file.

Another best way to open and close file is:

with open("spyder.txt") as file:
  print(file.readline())
  
This will close the file automatically.

> To print every lines in upper case:

with open("spider.txt") as file:
  for line in file:
    print(line.upper())
    
> To print every lines in upper case but this time trying to avoiding the line spacing:

with open("spider.txt") as file:
  for line in file:
      print(line.strip().upper()) # this will strip all the blank spaces in the line including new line char
