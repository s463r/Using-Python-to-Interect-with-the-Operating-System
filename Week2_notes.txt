## Beginning of week 2 ##

### Reading and Writing Files ###

> To open a file:

file = open("spider.txt") ## opening file
print(file.readline())

print(file.read())

file.close() ## closing file

* It is a good idea to close your file whenever you are done with your file.

Another best way to open and close file is:

with open("spyder.txt") as file:
  print(file.readline())
  
This will close the file automatically.

> To print every lines in upper case:

with open("spider.txt") as file:
  for line in file:
    print(line.upper())
    
> To print every lines in upper case but this time trying to avoiding the line spacing:

with open("spider.txt") as file:
  for line in file:
      print(line.strip().upper()) # this will strip all the blank spaces in the line including new line char

> Putting the file in a list so that we chould then sort the list and print:

file = open("spider.txt")
lines = file.readlines()
file.close()
lines.sort()
print(lines)

> To write on a file:

with open("spider.txt", "w") as file:
  file.write("It was a dark and stormy night")
  
### Managing Files and Directories ###


> to delete a file:

import os
os.remove("novel.txt")
os.rename("first_draft.txt","finished_masterpiece.txt") # renaming a file name

> To check if a file does exist in the directory:

os.path.exists("file_name.txt")

> To get the size of the file:

os.path.getsize("spider.txt")

> To check when the file was last modified:

os.path.getmtime("spider.txt")
import datetime
timestamp = os.path.getmtime("spider.txt") # will return time in form of unix timestamp
datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp) # converting the timestamp


> finding file using absolute file path:

os.path.abspath("spider.txt")

> To get the current working directory:

print(os.getcwd())

> to create a new directory:

os.mkdir("new_dir")

> to change directory:

os.chdir("new_dir")

> to remove directory:

os.mkdir("newer_dir")
os.rmdir("newer_dir") # only delete directories which are empty, otherwise does not work.

> To find all the directories inside a given directory:

os.listdir("website")


dir = "website"
for name in os.listdir("dir"):
  fullname = os.path.join(dir,name)
  if os.path.isdir(fullname):
    print(f"{fullname} is a directory")
  else:
    print(f"{} is a file")
